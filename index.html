    <h1>Pixeled Brewing Database</h1>
    <p>We developed a database for the Pixeled Brewing Website for our final project.  Pixeled Brewing was founded by John-Paul Klein with the unique idea
        to fuse brewing with old, classic arcade games. A former group member, we decided to stick to his goal and finish the project that he started to renovate the Pixeled Brewing website.
